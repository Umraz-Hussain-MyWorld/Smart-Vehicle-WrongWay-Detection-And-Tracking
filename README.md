# Smart-Vehicle-WrongWay-Detection-And-Tracking
A Smart Vehicle WrongWay Detection and Tracking using YOLOV8 and Sort Algo

This project aims to detect vehicles on the road, track them, and determine if they are going in the wrong direction. If a vehicle is going in the wrong direction, the system will extract its number plate for further action. The project also includes saving images and videos of the wrong-way going vehicle. With these features, this project will help improve road safety by detecting and preventing wrong-way driving incidents.
