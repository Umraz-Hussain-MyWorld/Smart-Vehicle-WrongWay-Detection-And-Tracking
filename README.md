A Smart Real-Time Vehicle WrongWay Detection and Tracking using YOLOV8 and Sort Algo

## Language Used
- Python3.9 or above
- OpenCV2 4.7 or above

## Models used
- YoloV8  - To detect vehicles
- YoloV8  - to detect license plates
- SORT    - for tracking

This project aims to detect vehicles on the road, track them, and determine if they are going in the wrong direction. If a vehicle is going in the wrong direction, the system will extract its number plate for further action. The project also includes saving images and videos of the wrong-way going vehicle. With these features, this project will help improve road safety by detecting and preventing wrong-way driving incidents.
